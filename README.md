# 🔬 Crystal System Classification

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying the **crystal systems** (monoclinic, orthorhombic, and triclinic) of lithium-ion battery materials using a set of physicochemical features. The goal is to predict the crystal structure from features such as band gap, formation energy, density, and other structural properties.
